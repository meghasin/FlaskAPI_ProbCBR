## Deploying Case based reasoning method to predict potential drugs to treat disease using Flask


### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

Flask version: 0.12.2
conda install flask=0.12.2  (or) pip install Flask==0.12.2

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code for the model to predict drug given disease using Cse-based reasoning approach.
2. app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. template - This folder contains the HTML template (index.html) to allow user to enter disease and number of top ranked answers.
4. static - This folder contains the css folder with style.css file which has the styling required for out index.html file.

### Steps to elaborate how to deploy a simple Machine Learning model using Flask APIRunning the project
1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory. Create the machine learning model by running below command from command prompt -
```
python model.py
```
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python app.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or) http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage.

Enter valid numerical values in all the input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should  be able to see the predcited salary vaule on the HTML page!
